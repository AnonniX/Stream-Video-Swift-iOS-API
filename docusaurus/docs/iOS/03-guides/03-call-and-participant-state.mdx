title: Call & Participant State
description: How the state is exposed
---

## Call State

When you join a call, we expose the following observable `state` from the `Call` object:

- `participants` - dictionary of the participants in the call
- `callData` - the call data
- `reconnectionStatus` - whether the call is reconnecting
- `recordingState` - the recording state of the call
- `participantCount` - number of participants connected to the call

The `state.callData` provides additional information about the call:

- `callCid`: `String` - the call cid, in the format type:callId.
- `members`: `[Member]` - the members of the call.
- `blockedUsers`: `[User]` - the blocked users.
- `createdAt`: `Date` - the creation date of the call.
- `backstage`: `Bool` - whether the call is in backstage.
- `broadcasting`: `Bool` - whether the call is being broadcasted.
- `endedAt`: `Date?` - optional end date of the call.
- `recording`: `Bool` - whether the call is being recorded.
- `startsAt`: `Date?` - the starting date of the call.
- `updatedAt`: `Date` - the update date of a call.
- `hlsPlaylistUrl`: `String` - hls playlist url if the call is being broadcasted.
- `customData`: `[String: Any]` - any custom data that you passed while creating the call.
- `autoRejectTimeout`: `Int` - the auto reject timeout, if it's a ringing call.
- `session`: `CallSession?` - the session associated with the call.
- `createdBy`: `User` - the user who created the call.

## Call Participant

When users join a call, they become `CallParticipant`s. The call participants are available from the `CallViewModel`'s `callParticipants` property, as a dictionary, or directly from the `call`'s `state` observable object.

You can use this property to filter participants, based on their properties. Here's a list of the info that is available about the `CallParticipant`:

- `id`: `String` - The unique call id of the participant.
- `userId`: `String` - The user's id. This is not necessarily unique, since a user can join from multiple devices.
- `role`: `String` - The user's role in the call.
- `name`: `String` - The user's name.
- `profileImageURL`: `URL?` - The user's profile image URL.
- `trackLookupPrefix`: `String?` - The id of the track that's connected to the participant.
- `hasVideo`: `Bool` - Returns whether the participant has video.
- `hasAudio`: `Bool` - Returns whether the participant has audio.
- `isScreensharing`: `Bool` - Returns whether the participant is screen sharing.
- `track`: `RTCVideoTrack?` - Returns the participant's video track.
- `trackSize`: `CGSize` - Returns the size of the track for the participant.
- `screenshareTrack`: `RTCVideoTrack?` - Returns the screen sharing track for the participant.
- `showTrack`: `Bool` - Returns whether the track should be shown.
- `isSpeaking`: `Bool` - Returns whether the participant is speaking.
- `sessionId`: `String` - Returns the session id of the participant.
- `connectionQuality`: `ConnectionQuality` - Returns the connection quality of the participant.
- `joinedAt`: `Date` - Returns the date when the user joined the call.
- `isPinned`: `Bool` - Returns whether the current user is pinned.
- `audioLevel`: `Float` - The audio level of the current participant.

These properties can be used to do custom filtering of the participants. For example, if you want to get the first user who is speaking, you can do the following:

```swift
var speaker: CallParticipant? {
    participants.first { $0.isSpeaking }
}
```
