description: Install the SDK for video calling

The Swift SDK can be installed using Swift Package Manager, if you are starting a new project we always recommend using the latest release.
Releases and changes are published on the [Github releases page](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-video-swift/releases).

### Add the SDK to your project

To add `StreamVideo` SDK, open Xcode and follow these steps:

- In Xcode, go to File -> "Add Packages..."
- Paste the URL https://github.com/GetStream/stream-video-swift.git
- In the option "Dependency Rule" choose "Branch," in the single text input next to it, enter "main"

- Choose "Add Package" and wait for the dialog to complete.
- Select `StreamVideo` and `StreamVideoSwiftUI` (if you use SwiftUI, otherwise also select `StreamVideoUIKit`).

### Permissions

Making a video call requires the usage of the camera and the microphone of the device. Therefore, you need to request permissions to use them in your app. In order to do this, you will need to add the following keys and values in your `Info.plist` file.

`Privacy - Camera Usage Description` - "Your_app_name requires camera access in order to capture and transmit video"
`Privacy - Microphone Usage Description` - "Your_app_name requires microphone access in order to capture and transmit audio"

Stream video support both Remote Notifications and VoIP notifications. See the [Push Notification](../../advanced/push-notifications) section for more details.
