In most cases, you should rely on the `CallViewModel` and its events for building and updating your UI. However, in some cases you might need access to the underlying events.

## Call Events

The call events are provided as async streams of data. You can subscribe to these streams, to log or perform some action with these events.

### Listening to all events

You can listen to all raw WS events via the `allEvents` async stream in the call object:

```swift
Task {
    for await event in call.allEvents() {
        print(event)
    }
} 
```

### Listening to specific events

However, in most cases you will be interested in a specific type of event.

#### Participant Events

In order to listen to the participant events, you should subscribe to the async stream `participantEvents`:

```swift
Task {
    for await event in call.participantEvents() {
        print(event)
    }
}
```

#### Permission requests and updates

To listen to permission requests, you should subscribe to the `permissionRequests` async stream:

```swift
Task {
    for await event in call.permissionRequests() {
        print(event)
    }
}
``` 

Similarly, you can listen to permission updates:

```swift
Task {
    for await event in call.permissionUpdates() {
        print(event)
    }
}
```

#### Recording events

Recording events are available via the `recordingEvents` async stream:

```swift
Task {
    for await event in call.recordingEvents() {
        print(event)
    }
}
```

#### Broadcasting events

Broadcasting events are available via the `broadcastingEvents` async stream:

```swift
Task {
    for await event in call.broadcastingEvents() {
        print(event)
    }
}
```

#### Custom events and reactions

You can listen to custom events via the following async stream:

```swift
Task {
    for await event in call.customEvents() {
        print(event)
    }
}
```

Similarly, you can listen to reactions with the following code:

```swift
Task {
    for await event in call.reactions() {
        print(event)
    }
}
```

## Stream Video events

When a call is not created, you can listen to call events from the `StreamVideo` object:

```swift
Task {
    for await event in streamVideo.callEvents() {
        print(event)
    }
}
```

These events are suitable for cases like showing an incoming call screen.
