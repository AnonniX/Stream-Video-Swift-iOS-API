The audio indicator gives you a visual feedback when a user is speaking. To understand who's speaking we provide the following attributes from the `CallParticipant`:
- `isDominantSpeaker` - whether the participant is the dominant speaker on the call.
- `isSpeaking` - whether the participant is speaking.
- `audioLevel` - the current audio level of the user.

### Audio Volume Indicator

You can use the `AudioVolumeIndicator` component to display the audio levels of the participant. For example, you can store the last few `audioLevel` value of the participant and provide them to the component for visualization.

Here's an example how to do that:

```swift
AudioVolumeIndicator(
	audioLevels: [0.8, 0.9, 0.7],
	maxHeight: 14
    minValue: 0,
    maxValue: 1
)
```

The component expects the following parameters:
- `audioLevels` - array of `Float` values that are going to be displayed.
- `maxHeight` - the max height of one tick of the indicator.
- `minValue` - the min value that can be displayed.
- `maxValue` - the max value that can be dispalyed.

### Showing Audio Levels in Lobby

If you want to build a custom pre-joining (lobby) view, that's displayed to users before they join the call, you might want to show an indicator of the audio levels of the current user.

In order to do this, you can use the `MicrophoneChecker` and the `MicrophoneCheckView` from the `StreamVideo` SwiftUI SDK. The `MicrophoneChecker` is an observable class that provides updates for the last decibel values of the current user. The `MicrophoneCheckView` presents them in a reusable view component.

Both components are used in our `LobbyView`, that you can also directly use in your apps.

Here's an example usage. First, you instantiate the `MicrophoneChecker` class, e.g. as a `@StateObject`, if it's used directly in your SwiftUI views:

```swift
@StateObject var microphoneChecker = MicrophoneChecker()
```

Optionally, you can provide a `valueLimit` in the initalizer of the `MicrophoneChecker`. By default, this value is 3, which means it returns the last three decibel values. You can pass a bigger number if you want to show more values to the user.

Then, in the `MicrophoneCheckView`, you pass the decibels array, as well as whether the `microphoneChecker` has any decibel values. If this value is `false`, the UI shows warning to the user that they might have an issue with their microphone.

```swift
MicrophoneCheckView(
	decibels: microphoneChecker.decibels,
	microphoneOn: callViewModel.callSettings.audioOn,
    hasDecibelValues: microphoneChecker.hasDecibelValues                    
)
```
